# Scalable-addressing-and-routing-protocol-for-ad-hoc-networks - Programming part
The aim of the thesis is to design a highly scalable decentralized network addressing and routing protocol for ad-hoc networks. The network addresses will be assigned and dynamically reassigned so that the nodes are kept in a loose tree-like hierarchy of addressable groups. The design will differ from other such protocols by being completely stateless (to aid reliability) and able to organize the network in a way that minimizes the sizes of the routing tables on all nodes (to improve efficiency). The resulting protocol will be implemented in a matching network simulator for being tested, benchmarked, and possibly compared with other protocols.
